In this thesis, we present a method to describe the accuracy function based on condition number. We introduce one special method to estimate homography with normalization. In addition, we introduce our simulation design in order to verify our assumption. Also we prove that why the method using error covariance matrix to describe the accuracy function from \cite{bauer2007tracking} does not work in our case. Finally, based on the condition number distribution in the given region we compare the accuracy of different paths computed with \texttt{A*} search algorithm and artificial potential fields method.
